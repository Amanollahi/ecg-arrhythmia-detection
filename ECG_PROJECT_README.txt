## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. Signal Preprocessing
- **Baseline Wander Removal**: High-pass Butterworth filter (0.5 Hz cutoff)
- **Powerline Interference**: Notch filter (60 Hz)
- **Combined**: Band-pass filter (0.5-40 Hz) preserving QRS complex
- **Implementation**: SciPy signal processing library

### 2. R-Peak Detection
- **Algorithm**: Pan-Tompkins (1985)
  - Derivative filter → emphasizes QRS slope
  - Squaring → amplifies high-frequency components
  - Moving window integration → smooths signal
  - Adaptive thresholding → finds peaks
- **Performance**: 95%+ sensitivity, 95%+ precision
- **Real-time capable**: <10ms processing per beat

### 3. Feature Extraction
Extracted 9 clinically-relevant features per heartbeat:

**Time-Domain Features**:
- RR interval (time between beats) - **MOST IMPORTANT (33.5%)**
- Heart rate variability metrics

**Morphological Features**:
- Beat energy (25.5% importance)
- QRS duration
- R-peak amplitude
- Statistical moments (mean, std, skewness, kurtosis)
- Peak-to-peak amplitude

### 4. Machine Learning Classification
- **Models**: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine
- **Class Balancing**: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling)
- **Validation**: 80/20 train-test split, stratified sampling
- **Best Model**: Random Forest (90%+ accuracy)
